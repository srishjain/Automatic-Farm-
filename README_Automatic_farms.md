# Automatic-Farm-
Farm monitoring and automatic controlling the farm using NodeMCU
In this project I have tried to interface nodemcu and arduino uno to get the desired result.
The arduino will keep track of the data usig sensors attached to it and control all the actuators present in the farm to control the farm.
The nodemcu will send the same data to web page and in the future I will try to store the same data on some cloud platform so that past farm statistics can be used in future so that
the data analyst could easily determine the type of soil, weather conditions and determine the best suitable crop to be grown for higher productivity from the same farm.
